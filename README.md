## 🚀 Custom Transformer Components

### Multi-Head Attention Variants

```python

# Multi-Query Attention (MQA) - Memory efficient

# Grouped Query Attention (GQA) - Balanced approach

# FlexAttention - PyTorch 2.5+ with custom score modifiers

```

### Advanced Feed-Forward Networks

```python
# SwiGLU Activation (used in LLaMA, PaLM)

# Mixture of Experts (MoE) Layer

```

## 🎯 Positional Encodings

```python
# Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)

# ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases)

```

## 📏 Advanced Normalization

```python
# Root Mean Square Layer Normalization (RMSNorm)

# Layer Normalization with configurable axis

# Pre/Post-LayerNorm placement

# Group Normalization for specific use cases

```

## 🔧 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)



```python
# LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

# AdaLoRA - Adaptive rank allocation

```

### Adapters and Prefix Tuning

```python
# Bottleneck Adapters

# Prefix Tuning

```

## 💾 Memory Optimization



```python
# Gradient Checkpointing

# Method 1: Function-based checkpointing

# Method 2: Module-based checkpointing

# Method 3: Sequential checkpointing for transformer stack

# Advanced: Selective activation checkpointing

```

### Gradient Accumulation and Scaling

```python


# Mixed precision training with automatic scaling

```

## 🎛️ Custom Loss Functions & Training Techniques

```python
# Label Smoothing for Language Modeling

# Focal Loss for handling class imbalance

# Contrastive Learning Loss

# Custom learning rate schedulers

```

## 🔍 Advanced PyTorch Utilities

### Custom Data Flow and Hooks

```python
# Forward hooks for layer analysis

# Dynamic layer freezing/unfreezing

# Custom autograd functions

# Gradient clipping variants

```

### Model Surgery and Weight Manipulation

```python
# Weight initialization schemes

# Model pruning

# Weight averaging (Model soups)

```

## 🚀 Performance Optimization Tips

```python
# Compile model for faster execution (PyTorch 2.0+)
model = torch.compile(model, mode='max-autotune')  # or 'reduce-overhead', 'default'

# Use scaled dot-product attention (PyTorch 2.0+)
# Automatically uses FlashAttention when available

# Memory-efficient attention for long sequences

# Efficient sequence packing for training

```
